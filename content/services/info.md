These directions will only get you to the city street turn out. Once there you will need to find your way to the train using the access road. Your navigation app will not work on dirt roads, see the directions in the 3rd column to get you to the train. Your safety is your responsibility.

Be careful when crossing tracks. Using this file with a navigation app will use your cell data, see below for instructions if cell data is an issue.

Select which navigation app you use, if you don't know then select the navigation app for the type of phone you have. Next, select the location that you would like to go to and allow it to open in the navigation app of your choice.

If cell data is an issue then click on the location link to open it. Do NOT click start. In Google Nav click "steps", in Apple Maps click to the left of "GO", and you will see step by step directions that you can follow which will minimize cell data usage.
